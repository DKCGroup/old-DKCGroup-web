- title: "Printable, emissivity-adaptive and albedo-optimized covering for year-round energy savings"
  image: printable.png
  description: Temperature-adaptive radiative cooling materials overcome the overcooling problem of daytime radiative coolers by automatically switching their thermal emissivity in response to surface temperature. However, practical applications of these materials are limited. As a solution, we adopt a new optical structure with a temperature-adaptive material to enable roll-to-roll fabrication at low cost. Such a structure also features optimizable solar reflection, showing great potential in energy saving and thermal comfort in various climates.

- title: "Scalable and Durable Temperature-Stabilizing Janus Thermal Cloak"
  image: joule.png
  description: We realize a scalable and durable Janus thermal cloak (JTC) for all-season, passive temperature regulation through radiative cooling and photon recycling. Our field tests on electric vehicles show that the JTC achieves daytime subambient cooling by 8.0C in summer and nighttime supra-ambient warming by 6.8C in winter. The JTC is reliable, trulypassive, and does not involve phase change or moving parts, thus is promising for use in real-world applications in buildings, vehicles, and extraterrestrial environments.

  description: In this work, we demonstrate a single-pixel MIR micro-spectrometer that reconstructs the sample transmission spectrum by a spectrally dispersed light source instead of spatially grated light beams. The spectrally tunable MIR light source is realized based on the thermal emissivity engineered via the metal-insulator phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2).

Compared to conventional waveguides, the near-zero-index waveguides are superior in maintaining a high mode-filling factor for small device sizes close to the diffraction limit and reducing the crosstalk in between at a sub-wavelength separation.

  description: We approached thermal regulation from an all-season perspective by developing a mechanically flexible coating that adapts its thermal emittance to different ambient temperatures. The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15°C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30°C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition.

- title: "Flat bands in magic-angle bilayer photonic crystals at small twists"
  image: TBPC.png
  description:  In this work, we formulate a coupled-mode theory for low-angle twisted bilayer honeycomb photonic crystals as a close analogy of TBG, discovering magic-angle photonic flat bands with a non-Anderson-type localization. Moreover, the interlayer separation constitutes a convenient degree of freedom in tuning photonic moir´e bands without high pressure. A phase diagram is constructed to correlate the twist angle and separation dependencies to the photonic magic angles.

  image: GMIT.png
  description: Here, an unusual material platform is shown in which ε can be engineered to decrease in an arbitrary manner near room temperature (|dε/dT| ≈ 8e−3 \°C), enabling unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation. As an example, εint is programmed to vary with temperature as the inverse of T^4, precisely counteracting the T^4 dependence; hence, thermal radiance from the surface becomes temperature-independent, allowing the fabrication of flexible and power-free infrared camouflage with unique advantage in performance stability.

  description: Here 0.2 V MEM switching devices with ≳10^6 safe operating cycles in ambient air are reported, which achieve the lowest operating voltage in mechanical switches without body bias reported to date. The ultralow operating voltage is mainly enabled by the abrupt phase transition of nanolayered vanadium dioxide (VO2) slightly above room temperature.
