  image: micro-spectrometer.png
  description: In this work, we demonstrate a single-pixel MIR micro-spectrometer that reconstructs the sample transmission spectrum by a spectrally dispersed light source instead of spatially grated light beams. The spectrally tunable MIR light source is realized based on the thermal emissivity engineered via the metal-insulator phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2).

- title: "Low-loss, geometry-invariant optical waveguides with near-zero-index materials"
  image: 
  description: Here we propose to use near-zero-index materials as a cladding layer for low-loss optical waveguides, where optical modes are tightly confined within the dielectric core region. Compared to conventional waveguides, the near-zero-index waveguides are superior in maintaining a high mode-filling factor for small device sizes close to the diffraction limit and reducing the crosstalk in between at a sub-wavelength separation.

- title: "Reducing temperature swing of space objects with temperature-adaptive solar or radiative coating"

  description: Here, we simulate and present the great potential of TASCs and TARCs as future passive TMTs for space objects. A case study of a geosynchronous satellite with body-mounted solar panels covered by TARC exhibits an interior temperature swing as small as 20.3°C–25.6°C in an orbital period even with solar eclipses.

- title: "Temperature-adaptive radiative coating for all-season household thermal regulation"
  image: TARC.png
  description: We approached thermal regulation from an all-season perspective by developing a mechanically flexible coating that adapts its thermal emittance to different ambient temperatures. The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15°C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30°C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition.

- title: "Flat bands in magic-angle bilayer photonic crystals at small twists"
  image: TBPC.png
  description:  In this work, we formulate a coupled-mode theory for low-angle twisted bilayer honeycomb photonic crystals as a close analogy of TBG, discovering magic-angle photonic flat bands with a non-Anderson-type localization. Moreover, the interlayer separation constitutes a convenient degree of freedom in tuning photonic moir´e bands without high pressure. A phase diagram is constructed to correlate the twist angle and separation dependencies to the photonic magic angles.

  description: In this work, we take a distinct approach of sensitizing surface radiation against minute temperature variation of the object. The emissivity of the thermal imaging sensitizer (TIS) rises abruptly at a preprogrammed temperature, driven by a metal-insulator transition in cooperation with photonic resonance in the structure.

- title: "A thermal radiation modulation platform by emissivity engineering with graded metal–insulator transition"
  image: GMIT.png
  description: Here, an unusual material platform is shown in which ε can be engineered to decrease in an arbitrary manner near room temperature (|dε/dT| ≈ 8e−3 \°C), enabling unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation. As an example, εint is programmed to vary with temperature as the inverse of T^4, precisely counteracting the T^4 dependence; hence, thermal radiance from the surface becomes temperature-independent, allowing the fabrication of flexible and power-free infrared camouflage with unique advantage in performance stability.

  description: Here, by exploiting the hysteretic phase transition of vanadium dioxide, an all-solid, rewritable metacanvas on which nearly arbitrary photonic devices can be rapidly and repeatedly written and erased is presented. The writing is performed with a low-power laser and the entire process stays below 90 °C.

  description: Here 0.2 V MEM switching devices with ≳10^6 safe operating cycles in ambient air are reported, which achieve the lowest operating voltage in mechanical switches without body bias reported to date. The ultralow operating voltage is mainly enabled by the abrupt phase transition of nanolayered vanadium dioxide (VO2) slightly above room temperature.
