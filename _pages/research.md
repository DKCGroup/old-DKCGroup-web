# Research

## Several major research topics (in the future):

### Smart radiative cooling

A huge portion of the energy consumption around the world is used to heat and cool buildings. To reduce this consumption and its related emissions, we develop a “smart” coating that can be attached to any roof, which automatically switches from radiating heat away from a home on a hot day to insulating it in cooler weather. The coating works best in areas where the temperature changes significantly from summer to winter or day to night.

### Smart MEMS

By integrating new functional materials into conventional MEMS devices, we develop smart MEMS for versatile smart city applications. We work on the design, modelling, fabrication, and characterization of MEMS.

### Moiré photonics

The new physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene motivated extensive studies of flat bands hosted by moiré superlattices in van der Waals structures, inspiring the investigations into their photonic counterparts with potential applications.
  
### Phase-change materials

The deposition, synthesis and modulation of phase-change material thin films and nanoparticles for device applications.

### ... and more.
